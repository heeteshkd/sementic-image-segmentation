# Sematic Image Segmentation
Semantic Image Segmentation is Computer Vision Task in which we should label each pixel depending on what is being shown
For this we use the UNet Architecture
![UNet](https://nchlis.github.io/2019_10_30/architecture_unetV2.png)
This architecture was implemented in Pytorch and was train on [CARAVANA Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/carvana-image-masking-challenge/data)
This model was train to identify cars from surroundings and obtained 0.986 F1 score
